# Daily_Transcations_Analysis
Unlocking Insights from Everyday Transactions!

As part of a recent project, I designed an end-to-end data analysis and visualization dashboard that explored over 2,000+ real-life transactions — including expenses, income, categories, and trends.

🔍 What I Did:

Analyzed transaction distributions using histograms, KDE curves, box plots, and scatter plots

Identified spending trends in categories like Food, Transportation, Grocery, and Milk

Found key behavioral insights:

🍽️ Milk is the most purchased item (over 160 transactions)

💳 Most transactions happen via credit card & bank account

💰 Expenses far outweigh income transactions — pointing to consumption-heavy behavior

🏦 Strong correlation between savings & investment behavior

📊 Tools Used: Excel for Dashboarding | Python (Seaborn, Matplotlib) for Data Visualization | PPT for Storytelling

💡 Key Takeaways:
This project helped me understand how to:

Detect outliers and spending patterns

Derive marketing insights from raw financial data

Use visualization to make data intuitive and actionable

✅ Whether you're a data enthusiast or a business aiming to understand customer behavior, this kind of insight is gold.
